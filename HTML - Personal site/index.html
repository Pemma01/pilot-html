  <p><strong>I can rank as some things:</strong></p>
  <p><em>Art Enthusiast wannabe</em></p>
  <p><em>Writer (Just because I think I am one)</em></p>
  <p><em>Mathematician (You can argue that)</em></p>
  <p><em>Farmer</em></p>
  <p><em>Fashion Designer</em></p>
  <p><em>... Let's agree that we can do without my announcing the rest of my jack-of-all-trade-ness...</em></p>
  <p><strong>And now, as if this conundrum that is my life isn't bogus enough, I've set out to become a software developer,</p>
  <p><strong>and I have managed to pull you in as a spectator. Enjoy the show *Low bow* </strong></p>

    <li>I have started and run a couple of businesses over the years with some amazing successes and some profound failures.</li>
    <li>In between all this, I was a seemingly diligent student at the University of Life.</li>

  <h2><strong>Hobbies</strong></h2>
  <ol>

    <li>Drawing (Interest is not equal to skill).</li>
